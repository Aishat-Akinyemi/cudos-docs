# Blockchain Compute

This is the user guide for Cudos Blockchain Computeâ€™s technical preview. Cudos Blockchain Compute is an innovative service that allows users to access computing resources via Smart Contract, permissionlessly.

For the duration of the technical preview, users are able to call Virtual Machines by using the UI, or if you prefer: interacting directly with the Smart Contract, via CLI.
