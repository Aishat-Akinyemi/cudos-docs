# Preparations

## Requirements

To be a consumer, you only need access to the Cudos blockchain, an SSH key, and some CUDOS tokens.

:::info
If you simply want to purchase a VM, and would prefer to use a UI, you can use the [website](https://compute.cudos.org).

This documentation is only needed if you want to create your own integration with the contract, or just want to learn how the system works.

## Contract Addresses

The Cudos Blockchain Compute contract has different addresses on different networks.
