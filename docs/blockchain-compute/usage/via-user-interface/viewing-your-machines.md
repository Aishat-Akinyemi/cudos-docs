# Viewing Your Virtual Machines

On this page you can view all the machines you’ve created.

There are a few machine states to be aware of: 

**Pending** - Your machine is starting up  
**Running** - Your machine has started and is running   
**Finished** - Your machine has run out of tokens and has finished running  
**Failed** - Something went wrong and the machine failed to start   

You can also click on your machine’s ID to view a more detailed page about it. Doing so will take you to this page:

From here you can do a few things. You can stop and restart your machine, as well as destroy it completely which will refund you of any unspent tokens outside of your current billing period.
