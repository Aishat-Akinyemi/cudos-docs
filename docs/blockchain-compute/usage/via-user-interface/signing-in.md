# Signing In

When first visiting the [Cudos Blockchain Compute homepage](https://compute.cudos.network/), you’ll be greeted by a landing page. This page sets out what we’re seeking to achieve and is also your gateway to the dApp. Take a second to familiarise yourself if you haven’t already. Also, of note is the Survey link at the bottom of the page **which must be completed to be eligible for the airdrop. **

In the top right corner, you’ll find a ‘Connect Wallet’ button. Click this and hit ‘Connect Keplr’.

A window will then pop up prompting you to add the CudosNetwork chain address to your Keplr Wallet, please accept this. 

With that, you’re all set up and ready to make some machines!
