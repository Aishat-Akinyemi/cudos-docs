Authentication on the Cudos network is enabled using digital signatures. 

Cudos uses the secp2561k digital key scheme to generate digital signatures. Secp2561k refers to the parameters of the elliptic curve used with the ECDSA Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. ECDSA is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

The ECDSA key pairs generated via elliptic curve cryptography are smaller than the average keys generated by digital signing algorithms. The sender of a transaction signs it using their own private key. On-chain signature verification is enabled by storing the public key in the 'Account' object.

## ECDSA Signing algorithm

Signing takes an input message + private key to produce a signature as follows:

1. Message hash is computed using a hash function. **SHA 256**

2. 

A digital signature is created as follows:

* A hash function is used to generate a hash of the data. 
* The hashed data is then signed using the sender's private key.

1. This ensures the ***integrity*** of the data as modification is not possible without access to the original sender's private key.  

2. The verifier has ***assurance*** of data origin authentication as the only way the digital signature could be decrypted is using the sender's private key. It is computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party's private key.

3. Anyone can verify the digital signature by computing a hash of the data and checking whether the decryption of the digital signature results in the same hash. This provides ***non-repudiation***. 

A digital signature scheme consists of three algorithms:

1. A key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys. The algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key.

2. A signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.

3. A signature verifying algorithm that, given the message, public key and signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.

Elliptic curve cryptography is a public-key cryptography system Cryptography is integral to security and trust on the Cudos network.

The Cudos blockchain uses digital signatures based on [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) or ECDSA public key cryptography. SECP256k1 in particular, is the name of the elliptic curve. 


The Cudos blockchain uses this curve to implement public key cryptography, which uses a key pair (public and private keys) to validate transaction signatures.
