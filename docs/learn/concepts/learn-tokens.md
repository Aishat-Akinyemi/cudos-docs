## NFT tokens
In order for a contract to be considered a NFT-contract it has to follow the NEP-171 and NEP-177 standards. The NEP-171 & NEP-177 standards explain the minimum interface required to be implemented, as well as the expected functionality.

## ERC-tokens

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

ERC-20 - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
ERC-721 - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
ERC-777 - ERC-777 allows people to build extra functionality on top of tokens such as a mixer contract for improved transaction privacy or an emergency recover function to bail you out if you lose your private keys.
ERC-1155 - ERC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions â€“ thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.
ERC-4626 - A tokenized vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
