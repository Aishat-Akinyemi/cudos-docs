This section explains fungible and non-fungible token types for inter-blockchain and Ethereum. 

## CW Tokens

**cw20** is a specification for fungible tokens based on CosmWasm. The name and design is loosely based on Ethereum's ERC20 standard. cw20 tokens can be imported by smart contracts that wish to implement this specification, or by contracts that call to any standard cw20 contract.

## NFT tokens

See ERC-721 and 
In order for a contract to be considered a NFT-contract it has to follow the NEP-171 and NEP-177 standards. The NEP-171 & NEP-177 standards explain the minimum interface required to be implemented, as well as the expected functionality.

## ERC-tokens

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

**ERC-20** - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.

**ERC-721** - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like a deed for artwork or a song.

**ERC-777 - ERC-777** - These standards allow people to build extra functionality on top of tokens such as a mixer contract for improved transaction privacy.

**ERC-1155 - ERC-1155** - These standards allow for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.

**ERC-4626** - A tokenised vault standard designed to optimize and unify the technical parameters of yield-bearing vaults.
