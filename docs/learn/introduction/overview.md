# Cudos (WiP)

Cudos is a Delegated Proof-of-Stake, layer-1 blockchain with a vision for a decentralised computation accessible on-chain.

The design of the Cudos network separates **consensus** from **execution** to ensure secure, decentralised and permissionless access to high-performance computing at scale.

**Builders** on the network get access to:
- 🔧 High application performance
- 🏗 Developer-friendly toolkit
- 💱 Composable asset management

**Users** of the chain benefit from:
- 🔐 High cryptographic security
- 🔬 Public blockchain transparency
- 📬 Cross-chain interoperability
- 🌳 Carbon-neutral transactions

## Proof-of-Stake Consensus

A **Tendermint Core** engine manages consensus - powered by a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus model. The BFT model can tolerate less than one-third of the Byzantine validators reaching consensus. Considered to be a gold standard in Proof-of-Stake consensus, it is the most widely used consensus engine across the industry.

## Why use the Cudos Network? 	

Integrated toolkit - Write Smart Contracts, Deploy Smart Contracts, Build a dApp to integrate with Smart Contracts, Use Decentralized Cloud Infra for Compute and Storage

### Cross-chain interoperability

Cudos is fully interoperable with the wider blockchain ecosystem. It utilises the Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable the seamless transfer of tokens, assets, NFTs and data to and from other blockchains throughout the Cosmos Ecosystem.

### Cudos Bridge

The **Cudos Network Bridge** enables is bridged to Ethereum and will be bridged to major blockchains in the future.

### Developer Friendly

Cudos Network supports smart contract development that compile to Web Assembly via CosmWasm. Rust developers have many tools to get up and running including a fully fledged testnet to build with, and developer SDKs like Cudos Blast to aid testing and deployment
