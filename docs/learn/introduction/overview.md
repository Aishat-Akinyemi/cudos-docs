# Cudos 

Cudos is a delegated Proof-of-Stake, Layer-1 blockchain with a vision for a Layer-2 community governed Compute network (expected Q1 2023). 

The design of the Cudos network separates **consensus** from **execution** to ensure secure, decentralised and permissionless access to high-performance computing at scale.

**Builders** on the network get access to:
🔧 High application performance
🏗 Developer-friendly toolkit
💱 Composable asset management

**Users** of the chain benefit from:
🔐 High cryptographic security
🔬 Public blockchain transparency
📬 Cross-chain interoperability
🌳 Carbon-neutral transactions

## Proof-of-Stake Consensus

A **Tendermint Core** engine manages consensus - powered by a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus model. The BFT model can tolerate less than one-third of the Byzantine validators reaching consensus. Considered to be a gold standard in Proof-of-Stake consensus, it is the most widely used consensus engine across the industry.

## Why use the Cudos Network? 	

Integrated toolkit - Write Smart Contracts, Deploy Smart Contracts, Build a dApp to integrate with Smart Contracts, Use Decentralized Cloud Infra for Compute and Storage 

### Cross-chain interoperability

Cudos is fully interoperable with the wider blockchain ecosystem. It utilizes the Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable the seamless transfer of tokens, assets, NFTs and data to and from other blockchains throughout the Cosmos Ecosystem. 

Cudos Network Bridge 

The **Cudos Network Bridge** enables is bridged to Ethereum and will be bridged to major blockchains in the future. 

Developer ecosystem
With the mainnet release, developers will use the Cudos blockchain for deploying smart contracts, making it way cheaper than building on Ethereum. In addition, the Cudos network will become truly limitless as developers can build new solutions, projects utilising Cosmos SDKs on the network. 

The seamless interoperability that Cudos offers will open doors for commercial deployment as developers can build dApps, and other projects on our native blockchain, powering the future of web 3.0. Interested developers can join our Discord group or Telegram community to engage further.  

Powering the metaverse 
Once our mainnet is live, it will be merged with our Cudo compute platform, paving the path for scalable compute to power gaming, NFTs, and metaverses. As the world of NFTs and metaverses evolves, the demand for computing capability is poised to increase 1000 times, and Cudo compute is well-positioned to fill in the gap. 

Token utility
With the Cudos network migrating from Ethereum to our native blockchain, the ERC-20 tokens will migrate into CUDOS native tokens. After the mainnet launch, CUDOS will become the native token on the network providing PoS security. The token holders can stake, earn, and participate in governance using CUDOS. On the developers’ front, they could use CUDOS in their smart contracts and earn a share of community rewards based on their dApp popularity.
