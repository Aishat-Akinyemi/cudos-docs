# Introduction

Running a **Validator node** is a unique opportunity to be a part of a project and wider ecosystem aimed at solving todays blockchain scalability and interoperability issues.

This section is intended to assist participation in the **Cudos network** as a **Validator operator**. 
To join the network we recommend you first try running a node on the **Testnet**. The Testnet is a playground where you can learn and experiment without the risk of losing real tokens.

The Cudos Network is based on [**Tendermint**](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html) and [**Cosmos**](https://cosmos.network/). It is secured by **Validators** responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain using **Proof-of-Stake consensus**.

## Why run a node?

1. Running a validator node is critical to the Cudos network's success. Validator nodes are vital for relaying **transactions**, **proposing, verifying** and **finalising** blocks. 

2. The **maintenance** and **security** of the Cudos network relies on a community of Validator operators to run nodes to ensure the integrity and viability of the network. 

3. In return for securing the network, Validator operators earn **rewards** depending on their overall stake in the network. 

4. **Validator operators** have the opportunity to contribute to the **development** and **evolution** of the network by using their “stake” to vote on **governance proposals**. This is instrumental to the future direction of the Cudos Network.

## Networks 

The following networks are available to run a node. Each network has its own set of **Validator nodes**.
