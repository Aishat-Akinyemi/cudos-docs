A **Delegator** is someone who delegates (stakes) CUDOS tokens to one or more **Validator nodes** of their choice. In return, they receive a share of block rewards. 

Delegating additional CUDOS to a **Validator node** contributes to increasing the validatorsâ€™ **Voting Power**. The validators with the most **Voting Power** are selected more often to **propose blocks** and therefore earn more rewards. 

Tokens delegated to a **Validator node** are kept in a pool. The Validator and its Delegators share rewards based on the amounts they have contributed to this pool.

Tokens remain on the Delegator's wallets but can only be accessed again once **un-delegated**. The un-delegation process is quick and easy to perform but there is an **unbonding period of 21 days** before tokens are released. 

Delegators can also participate in governance. Voting Power is proportional to the amount staked.

:::caution Risks

Sharing rewards also means sharing risks. 

There is the possibility of slashing if a Validator has a downtime or double signing event. It is therefore important to carefully select Validators based on their **uptime**, **reliability** and **participation** in governance. 

1. Perform due diligence on Validators before committing funds. 

2. Monitor the Validator node including the commission rate.

3. Delegators can switch to another Validator (Rebonding is immediate).
