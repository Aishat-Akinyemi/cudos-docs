## The Keyring

Cudos-noded CLI commands require a Cudos account controlled by a private key. Private keys must be stored securely without being exposed to a potential attacker.

The **keyring** is used to store and manage the keys used to interact with a node. The keyring can be configured with one of several backend implementations:



A validator key needs to be set up before running the blockchain node, so that blocks can be correctly signed. 

The private key can be stored in different locations such as a file or the operating system's own key storage.



## Validator node security

Validators must consider whether they want to be fully responsible for Key Management or if they want to leverage third-party infrastructure to do so. 

The Cudos Network leverages the **Tendermint Key Management System** in order to ensure high availability access to signing keys as part of the Cudos Networkâ€™s block processing workflows.

## Tendermint Key Management System (KMS) (Beta)

Validators can research the Key Management System intended for Cosmos Validators. 
[Check it out](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms).

It provides isolated, optionally HSM-backed signing key management for transaction signing. Designed to be deployed on separate physical hosts. It provides the following:

1. High-availability access to validator signing keys
2. Double-signing prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
3. Hardware security module storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Hardware Security Modules

:::caution
Solutions for cloud-based infrastructure are still evolving. Check out discussions on [**Cosmos Hub Forum**](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/running-a-validator-in-a-cloud-environment/587) and in [**Validator Chat in Discord**](https://discord.com/channels/593796681103966208/849951329174421504).

It is crucial that an attacker cannot steal a validator's key. 

Key compromise puts the entire stake delegated to the compromised validator at risk. Hardware security modules are an important strategy for mitigating this risk.

HSM modules must support `ed25519` signatures. The YubiHSM2 supports `ed25519`. 
The following [Yubikey library is available](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/yubihsm.rs)

The **YubiKey** is a hardware authentication device manufactured by Yubico to protect access to computers, networks, and online services. It supports one-time passwords (OTP), public-key cryptography, and authentication. It allows users to securely log into their accounts by emitting one-time passwords or using a FIDO-based public/private key pair generated by the device.
