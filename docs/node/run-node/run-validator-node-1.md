This guide explains how to prepare and build a **Validator node**. This is a prerequisite to running a **Validator node** as part of a **Validator cluster** comprising at least one **Sentry node**.

:::warning Security

**Validator nodes** should not be run without being protected by a [**Sentry node architecture**](/docs/node/security/sentry-node-arch)

It follows on from the [build environment](/docs/node/prerequisites/build-envt) which is a prerequisite for this step. 

The steps to prepare a Validator node are:

### 1. Build a full node
### 2. Stake CUDOS to your node

## Networks

`Testnet`
`Mainnet`

## 01 Build a full node

## 02 Stake CUDOS to your node



The process for stashing a key on a full node or a validator is the same, however you should use a meaningful string as the name for your keyring; for example  `validator1keyring` if the wallet is going to be used by a validator, or `fullnode1keyring` if it is for a full node.
