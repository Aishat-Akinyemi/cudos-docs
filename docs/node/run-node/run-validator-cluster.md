title: Run a validator cluster
id: run-validator-cluster
---

This guide explains how to initialise and start a **Validator Cluster**. It walks you through configuring a Validator Cluster to work with Seed and Sentry nodes. 

A **Validator Cluster** or **Clustered Node** is a **Validator** node surrounded by **Seed** and **Sentry** nodes.
 
Once this is completed, it can be staked. 

:::note
If a clustered-node is left to the default neighbour configuration it will not try and connect to any other node and will just stall indefinitely waiting for chain infomation. As soon as another node contacts it, the synchronisation process will being.

## Networks

`Testnet`
`Mainnet`

:::tip
Your network was selected at the **Build Binary** stage.
:::

## 00 Prerequisites

1. This step assumes you have already built your environment and selected a network.
**Build Environment** instructions for your selected network. 

2. You have already started and synchronised the required **Seed nodes** and **Sentry nodes** to be added to your cluster. 

## 01 Configure the daemon 

1. Make sure you run as user `Cudos`

Inside the shell run the following command:

```shell
su - cudos
```

2. The following script can be run to automatically set up a **Validator Cluster** on the network. 

```shell
cudos-init-node.sh clustered-node
```
### Cudos Daemon Configuration tool

If you need to alter individual parameters, run `cudos-noded-ctl`. 

:::info How to use Cudos Daemon Configuration Tool

`cudos-noded-ctl` must be run as user cudos.

```shell
root@debian:~# su - cudos
```

```shell
cudos-noded-ctl [-h] <command> [command_options]
```

Below are all available CTL commands

BE AWARE: All modifications to `config.toml` must specify contents on a single line, comma separated list. 

```shell
# Define seeds to connect to: 
# "seeds=" variable in config.toml 
# Example: <tendermint ID>@<IP address or hostname>:<Port number>[,<tendermint ID>@<IP address or hostname>:<Port number>

cudos-noded-ctl set seeds "$CUDOS_HOME"/config/seeds.config

# Define a list of nodes to keep persistent connections to:
# persistent_peers = variable in config.toml with the the contents of <filename>

cudos-noded-ctl set persistent_peers "$CUDOS_HOME"/config/persistent-peers.config

# Define peerIDs to be kept private (without gossiping)
# private_peer_ids - variable in config.toml with contents of <filename>

cudos-noded-ctl set private_peers "$CUDOS_HOME"/config/private-peers.config

# Define peerIDs to which a connection will be (re)established ignoring any existing limits
cudos-noded-ctl set unconditional_peers "$CUDOS_HOME"/config/unconditional-peers.config

# Define peer exchange reactor (Boolean)

cudos-noded-ctl set pex true

# Activate unsafe RPC commands like /dial_seeds and /unsafe_flush_mempool (Boolean)

cudos-noded-ctl set unsafe true

# Activate Prometheus metrics served under /metrics on PrometheusListenAddr (Boolean)
cudos-noded-ctl set prometheus true

# Active seed mode (boolean)

cudos-noded-ctl set seed_mode false

# Define gas prices

cudos-noded-ctl set minimum-gas-prices "5000000000000acudos"
```

## 02 Stake the node

Ensure that each node in the **Validator Cluster** has started and has synchronised. 
Follow the instructions [**here**](/docs/node/run-node/stake-node.md) to stake the **Validator node** in the Cluster. 

## 03 Run the staked Validator node in the cluster using cosmovisor

It is recommended to use cosmovisor to run your node. 

`cosmovisor` monitors the governance module for incoming chain upgrade proposals. If it sees a proposal that gets approved, it can automatically download the new binary, stop the current binary, switch from the old binary to the new one and restart the node with the new binary.

It automates chain upgrades to virtually zero downtime. 

```shell
root@cudos-node:~# systemctl enable --now cosmovisor@cudos
```

Enable and start the service with Cosmovisor.

```shell
cudos@testnet:~# systemctl enable --now cosmovisor@cudos
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cosmovisor@cudos.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/cosmovisor@.service.
```

## 04 Stop the node running

```shell
root@cudos-node:~# systemctl disable --now cosmovisor@cudos
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cosmovisor@cudos.service.
```
