Monitoring is required for the *infrastructure*, *cudos-noded* & *supporting processes*.

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure setups differ. This varies highly from one setup to another. Here are a few basic metrics to monitor.

* CPU Usage
* Memory Usage
* Disk Usage (I/O)
* Disk Space
* Bandwidth

You can run the node and quickly establish baselines for some of these metrics.
