This is the suggested template for new Cudos Improvement Proposals

Note that a CIP number is assigned following initiation. 

Use an abbreviated title as the file name. 

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this CIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this? What benefit does it provide to the Cudos ecosystem? What use cases does it address?

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementation across the Cosmos Ecosystem. 

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
All CIPS that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. Include how to deal with these incompatibilities. 

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation.

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  

## Security Considerations
This section should discuss the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed.
