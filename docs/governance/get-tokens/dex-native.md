# Decentralised Exchange with Native CUDOS Tokens

:::tip
This exchange already supports the native CUDOS token for the CUDOS blockchain.
:::

You should be able to find the CUDOS token in the "Swap" or "Trade" section of this exchange application.
Once you have traded for CUDOS on the platform, the next steps are: send the tokens over IBC to the CUDOS Blockchain, and then be able to interact with dApps and features on the CUDOS blockchain.

1. Make sure you have a CUDOS address available, this is your public address that will begin with `cudos1` - if you don't have one yet, follow [this guide](../../learn/concepts/wallets/keplr-create.md) to create a new one with Keplr Wallet.
:::info
You likely have a Keplr or Cosmostation Wallet already, you may just need to add the CUDOS blockchain to the drop-down list, so you might only need from Step 6 in the above linked guide.
:::

2. Withdraw the tokens from the exchange's blockchain to your CUDOS address via IBC: find the withdraw option in the application and enter your CUDOS address. Also add the amount you wish to withdraw.
:::info
Your CUDOS address will begin with `cudos1`.
:::

3. Once the withdrawal transaction has completed, you will now see your funds sitting in your Keplr/Cosmostation wallet when the `CudosNetwork` is selected.

**Congratulations! You have Mainnet CUDOS tokens!**

Now what?

You can now interact with dApps built on CUDOS, buy computing with CUDOS tokens, purchase tokenised infrastructure NFTs, vote on governance proposals, and stake to earn a passive income on your tokens!
