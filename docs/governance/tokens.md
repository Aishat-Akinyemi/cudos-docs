**CUDOS** are the **native**, **utility** token powering the **CUDOS Network**.

Validators and Delegators stake CUDOS onto the network to secure it and earn staking rewards.

The **L1 - Consensus - Proof-of-Stake CUDOS Network** uses CUDOS tokens to govern and secure the network, incentivise participants and provide a mechanism to store and exchange value.

The **L2 - Application - Cudo Compute** platform (Q1 2023) will use CUDOS tokens to power the buying and selling of compute capacity on the network.

### Supply

The CUDOS token is a capped supply token. The total cap is fixed at 10 billion whilst the current circulating supply is approximately 2.8 billion. However, the circulating supply is not necessarily liquid as a large percentage of tokens are locked into staking contracts or set aside for rewards.

Our aim is to lock 75% of circulating supply into staking.

**Locked Circulating Supply**

Amount in CUDOS

* 1st year staking rewards: 306,000,000

* 1st year staking bonuses: ~150,000,000

* 1st year estimated total staked: ~1,875,000,000

TOTAL: ~2,331,000,000

Liquid circulating supply: ~169,000,000

### Token release

CUDOS tokens have a 10 year release plan until 100% of the total 10 billion have been fully vested and are in circulation.

* 25% released by January 2022

* 25% released by January 2023

* 25% released by January 2025

* 25% released by January 2031

### Token distribution

![token-distribution](@site/static/img/token-distribution.png)

**Ecosystem & Community Development** tokens are used to incentivise network and community growth. This pot includes prizes, airdrops, bounties, staking rewards & bonuses, developer programs, partnerships and grants.

**Reserve** tokens are for administration, operations, marketing and R&D

**Private sale** participants and advisors receive a percentage of their allocation each day via a vesting smart contract.

**Strategic investors** from previous rounds with allocations have their tokens locked for 6 months, with 18 months daily vesting thereafter. Itâ€™s important to note that whilst these tokens vest each day, these individuals may decide to only move their vested tokens once per week or once per month into either staking, a private wallet or onto an exchange. That can appear as a jump in tokens entering circulating supply.

**Team tokens** are locked for 6 months and then begin to vest quarterly over 3 years. The release of these tokens is dependent on the team reaching important development milestones, ensuring that the full vision of CUDOS is achieved.


### Token utility

The CUDOS token is used to pay transaction fees, stake and delegate in the CUDOS network.

**CUDOS Network**

Key token functions are:

1. Earning the right to validate and secure the CUDOS network requires a stake of 2,000,000 CUDOS.

2. Rewards are allocated as CUDOS in return for securing the network.

3. Delegators support Validators to secure the network and receive a proportion of rewards.

**Wider ecosystem**

Key token functions are:

1. Using CUDOS to perform transactions.

2. Using CUDOS to perform cross-chain transactions across the Cosmos ecosystem.
