## CUDOS Tokens

CUDOS tokens are the Layer 1 Cudos network's native utility token. They power the Cudos ecosystem providing the means to govern, secure the blockchain, incentivise participants, and provide a mechanism to store and exchange value.

The Layer 2 Cudo Compute platform (Q1 2023) will use CUDOS tokens to power the buying and selling of compute capacity on the network.

Providers of compute capacity can stake tokens and provide devices to the Compute infrastructure.
Any provider can built their reputational score or 'Trust score' by ensuring their devices and infrastructure have high **uptime**, **security** and **performance**. A higher stake of CUDOS tokens also contributes to a high Trust score by demonstrating the commitment of the provider.    

Providers are incentivised to maintain high performance to increase their '**Trust score**'. In doing so, they earn a discount on platform fees and more rewards as a higher 'Trust score' increases the likelihood of being selected to perform a compute job.

:::danger Slashing and Fees

* Providers of devices with poor performance will see their 'Trust score' decrease.
* Providers who do not fulfil a compute job will not receive their staked tokens.
This slashing mechanism provides insurance to consumers of compute jobs.

The **CUDOS Validator Network (CVN**) will verify all compute jobs and manage the distribution of CUDOS tokens to providers of compute infrastructure.

### Supply

The CUDOS token is a capped supply token. The circulating supply is approximately 2.8 billion and the total cap is fixed at 10 billion.

### Token utility

The CUDOS token can be used to pay transaction fees, staking and delegation on the Cudos network. 

### Rewards

CUDOS tokens power the Proof-of-Stake consensus on the Cudos Network.

Validators and Delegators stake CUDOS onto the network to secure it and earn staking rewards.

:::tip Validator Stake

To be a validator, requires **2,000,000 CUDOS** tokens.
