title: Initialise project
id: blast-init

Initialise a **Blast** project and get started interacting with the Cudos network. 

:::caution

Ensure that a new project is initialised in a directory other than the local `cudos-blast` repository
:::

1. Scaffold your dapp 

Create a new project folder (or navigate to your local cudos-blast project installation)

```bash
mkdir myCudosDapp
cd myCudosDapp

# Initialise a blast project

blast init
Success! Sample project initialized in /Users/username/projects/myCudosDapp
```

:::note 
You can also specify the full directory of the project using optional parameter `--dir` or `-d`

```bash
blast init --dir /Your/Location/Here
```
:::

2. Open your project in your favourite IDE.

## Project contents

![Project contents](/img/dapp-contents.png)

The `/src` directory contains the smart contract source code in different files.

1. `src/contract.rs` contains the main smart contract logic and is where the functions `instantiate()`, `execute()` and `query()` are implemented.

```rust


**contracts** - Sample contracts. Add more as desired.

**scripts** - Sample scripts to deploy a contract and interact with it.

**tests** - Test your contracts

**blast.config.js** - Config for connections and contract deployments

**cargo.toml** - Edit this file to add more contracts to compile. Contracts are compiled in alphabetical order using [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer). An **artifacts** folder is generated after compilation. 

**jsconfig.json** - Deployed code and contract references


:::successDone
## ðŸŽ‰ Nice work! 

Your project is now ready to work with the Cudos blockchain. It contains sample smart contracts and scripts to deploy or interact.
