title: Build a dApp Tutorial

First get the RPC endpoints and API endpoints

1. Clone the cosmwasm examples repo 

Using CosmWasmâ€™s default template contract as an example, this tutorial walks through the necessary steps to go from an idea to execution.

In this guide, you will learn:

* How to set up your environment for smart contract development and testing

* The basic structure and execution model for smart contracts

* The local build, upload, and testing process

Use a name source contract

I will show the components and the helpers.ts 

set up the chain id etc. 

* Instantiate a new contract 


In this tutorial we are going to be working with `nameservice`. This is a domain name service application to buy names and map values to those names. You can also transfer domain names. It is a cosmwasm contract example. 

## Back end

API Endpoints 

1. Start by cloning the cosmwasm contract examples repository which has the name service application inside.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts.git

cd cw-contracts
```

2. Open the folder in your favourite code editor. (We are using Visual Studio Code) and navigate to ***contracts > nameservice***

![cosm wasm examples](/img/nameservice.png)

3. View the `cargo.toml` file 

This is the dependency manager for the project. 

![cargo.toml](/img/cargotoml.png)

4. Open the src folder to view the smart contract code.

- Open the msg.rs 

```rust
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub purchase_price: Option<Coin>,
    pub transfer_price: Option<Coin>,
}
```

`InstantiateMsg` creates the initial state using the data inside. It sets the purchase price and transfer price.

```rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Register { name: String },
    Transfer { name: String, to: String },
```

`ExecuteMsg` is the core logic of how the smart contract is executed. This is an enumeration. Execute message can be a register or transfer.

```rust
pub enum QueryMsg {
    // ResolveAddress returns the current address that the name resolves to
    ResolveRecord { name: String },
    Config {},
}
```

`QueryMsg` requests the current state data from the smart contract. It is called to return the current address a name resolves to. 

### Contract.rs

```rust
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
    let config_state = Config {
        purchase_price: msg.purchase_price,
        transfer_price: msg.transfer_price,
    };

    config(deps.storage).save(&config_state)?;

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```
This is the instatiation logic.
It is mainly standard. 
It accepts 
dependencies
environment e.g. block information, contract address and block height. 
info - message info

So first it creates a purchase and it saves the state in a bucket as specified in the state configuration  `state.rs`.

Here there are different configurations for storage, read etc. 

```rust
pub fn config(storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> Singleton<Config> {
    singleton(storage, CONFIG_KEY)
}

pub fn config_read(storage: &dyn Storage) -> ReadonlySingleton<Config> {
    singleton_read(storage, CONFIG_KEY)
}
```

The resolver is the data structure that holds the name cells. 

## ExecuteMsg

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Register { name } => execute_register(deps, env, info, name),
        ExecuteMsg::Transfer { name, to } => execute_transfer(deps, env, info, name, to),
    }
}
```
This code has two functions if the register is received it is routed to `execute_register`. Or if the transfer is received it is routed to `execute_transfer`.

### execute_register

```rust
pub fn execute_register(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    name: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // we only need to check here - at point of registration
    validate_name(&name)?;
    let config_state = config(deps.storage).load()?;
    assert_sent_sufficient_coin(&info.funds, config_state.purchase_price)?;

    let key = name.as_bytes();
    let record = NameRecord { owner: info.sender };

    if (resolver(deps.storage).may_load(key)?).is_some() {
        // name is already taken
        return Err(ContractError::NameTaken { name });
    }
```
At this point, the name is validated. If it doesn't match a contract error is returned.
Then it checks that sufficient funds have been sent to perform the purchase.
The name record is set and put into a bucket. 

### execute_transfer
basically the same

## QueryMsg

```rust
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
        QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
    }
}
```

Here the Query function is a structured way to access the bucket data.
First it routes.

```rust
fn query_resolver(deps: Deps, _env: Env, name: String) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    let key = name.as_bytes();

    let address = match resolver_read(deps.storage).may_load(key)? {
        Some(record) => Some(String::from(&record.owner)),
        None => None,
    };
    let resp = ResolveRecordResponse { address };

    to_binary(&resp)
}
```

Then it queries the data store buckets.
If the data is found, it returns the record address. If not, it returns none. 

# Add a new record

## State.rs
Inside `state.rs`

add *pub_metadata* as a string. 

```rust
pub struct NameRecord {
    pub owner: Addr,
    pub_metadata: String,
}
```

## Contract.rs

Inside `contract.rs` add *metadata* under `execute_register` here:

```rust
pub fn execute_register(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    name: String,
    metadata: String,
```

and *metadata* here:

```rust
    let key = name.as_bytes();
    let record = NameRecord { owner: info.sender };
    metadata,

    if (resolver(deps.storage).may_load(key)?).is_some() {
        // name is already taken
        return Err(ContractError::NameTaken { name });
```

## Msg.rs

Inside msg.rs locate ExecuteMsg and add *metadata*

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Register { name: String, metadata: String },
    Transfer { name: String, to: String },
}
```
Now return to **contract.rs** and add *metadata* under the execute function as below:

```rust
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Register { name } => execute_register(deps, env, info, name, metadata),
        ExecuteMsg::Transfer { name, to } => execute_transfer(deps, env, info, name, to),
    }
}
