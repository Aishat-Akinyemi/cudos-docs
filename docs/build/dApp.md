## Web 2.0 Apps 

In traditional Web 2.0 application structure, a front-end application (like a webpage or an app) interacts with a back-end application (like an API or a database server). 




## Web 3.0 Apps

In Web 3.0 blockchain infrastructure, a front-end interacts directly with a blockchain network, reading the state of the chain or interacts with a back-end that connects directly to a blockchain network.


A decentralized network of computers (nodes) replaces databases and APIs used in traditional web services. The blockchain itself serves as a ***data store***, while the ***application*** (or state machine) run by the nodes takes the place of data-store APIs (by ingesting transactions and defining transitions between states).

:::note
In some cases, blockchain applications can also interact with a back-end that is in connection with the blockchain network. For instance, a blockchain-connected back-end infrastructure can save information to an external database to serve complex queries that would be expensive to perform on the chain itself.

### Front end

This is the Javascript, HTML, CSS user interface. It takes input from the user and builds requests to be sent to smart contracts.


### Back end

The backend is the smart contracts deployed to the Cudos Blockchain. 
Smart contracts contain the business logic of the application.
