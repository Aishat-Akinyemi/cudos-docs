A decentralized application (dApp) has three main components:

## Front end

This is the Javascript, HTML, CSS user interface. It takes input from the user and builds requests to be sent to smart contracts.
e.g. Create React App

## Back end

The backend is smart contracts deployed to the Cudos Blockchain. Smart contracts contain the business logic of the application.
