title: Compile messaging contract
id: compile-messaging
---

Before a contract can be used, it must be compiled into `wasm` bytecode or artefacts that can be stored on chain.

**CUDOS Blast** makes compilation easy with a single command.

## 01 Modify files 

1. Open **contracts > schema.rs** and replace *alpha* with your project-name.

![update-schema](@site/static/img/update-schema.png)

2. Open **src > cargo.toml** and replace *alpha* with your project-name

![update-cargo](@site/static/img/update-cargo.png)

## 02 Compile your contract

1. Make sure you have docker running.

2. Run the following command:
    ```shell
    blast compile
    ```

    ```shell
    # Example
    blast compile
