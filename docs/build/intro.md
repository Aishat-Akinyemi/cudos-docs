#### "CUDOS strives to seamlessly integrate the ownership economy of Web3 with sustainable cloud infrastructure. By utilizing data centers and idle resources, we can power next-generation experiences in gaming, rendering, AI, metaverses, node infrastructure, and various decentralised applications."

___
**A Decentralised Application, or dApp, usually consists of two main components:**

1. The consensus-driven business logic and representation of value using tokens - this is built with **Smart Contracts**.
2. The powerful stuff like web frontends, real-time 3D, rendering, model training - this is built with **Cloud Infrastructure**.

**CUDOS provides a one-stop-shop for both components:**

1. **CUDOS Network** is a Layer-1, CosmosSDK-based blockchain, with [CosmWasm](https://book.cosmwasm.com/) smart contracts written in [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
2. **CUDOS Blockchain Compute ([CBC](https://compute.cudos.org/))** is a permissionless infrastructure for provisioning cloud resources from the Blockchain.
