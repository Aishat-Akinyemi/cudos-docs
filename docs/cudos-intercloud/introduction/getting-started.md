# Getting Started

The first thing you’ll need to do is get yourself a Keplr wallet. The guide on how to do so can be found [here](https://docs.cudos.org/docs/learn/concepts/wallets/keplr-create/). 

Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to fund your wallet with CUDOS tokens - here is another guide on how to get [them](https://docs.cudos.org/docs/governance/get-tokens/).
