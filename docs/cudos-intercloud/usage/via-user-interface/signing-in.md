# Signing In

When first visiting the [CUDOS Intercloud homepage](https://intercloud.cudos.org/), you’ll be greeted by a landing page. This page sets out what we’re seeking to achieve and is also your gateway to the dApp. Take a second to familiarise yourself if you haven’t already. Also, of note is the Survey link at the bottom of the page. We would really appreciate it if you sent us some feedback!

In the top right corner, you’ll find a ‘Log in’ button. Click this and hit ‘Keplr’. 

A window will then pop up prompting you to add the CudosNetwork chain address to your Keplr Wallet, and another one to prove ownership and verify you are trying to connect to CUDOS Intercloud.
Please accept both.

With that, you’re all set up and ready to make some machines!
