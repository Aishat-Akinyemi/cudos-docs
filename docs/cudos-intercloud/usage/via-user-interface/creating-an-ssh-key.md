# Creating an SSH Key

Youâ€™ll need to have an SSH key in order to create a virtual machine. If you already have one, you can ignore this. 

For Windows Users - please follow [this guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen). 

For MacOS and Linux users: 

1. Open Terminal.
2. Paste the text below.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

This creates a new SSH key.

```bash 
Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair. 
``` 

When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", you can press Enter to accept the default file location. Please note that if you created SSH keys previously, ssh-keygen may ask you to rewrite another key, in which case we recommend creating a custom-named SSH key. To do so, type the default file location and replace id_ssh_keyname with your custom key name.

Your public key will end up in `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
You will need the contents of this file when you make a VM.
